# Nitro Type - Race Info Footer

This repository contains a userscript that adds an informational footer to the [Nitro Type race page](https://www.nitrotype.com/race). It was based on [@follycakes](https://www.nitrotype.com/racer/follycakes) version of the [Nitro Type-Racing Stats](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/446359-nitro-type-racing-stats) user script that was originally created by [Toonity](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/858426-toonidy) and [nate-dogg-nt](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/805959-nate-dogg-nt).
